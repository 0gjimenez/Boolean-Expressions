# Boolean Expressions
We can think of a program as a series of decisions and processeses to be executed.  This project shows how we can dream up complicated expressions to be conditionally evaluated.  We will explore conditionals in the next unit.

## Number Logic
Using mathematical notation, come up with boolean expressions which test the types of numbers we could feed into a program.  Useful things to know include:
-  greater than ">"
-  less than "<"
-  AND "&&"
-  OR " || "
-  EQUALS " == "

### Tasks
-  Initialize the variables to either  true or false.
-  Read each comment and complete the variable below.
-  Use you console.log() to display each variable and view its output.
-  Open the **terminal** and run the file by typing **node logicgates.js** then hit enter.
-  Record your results in the results file.
